## Support and community

GDS maintains the platform behind registers and helps custodians to run their registers. Custodians are expected to keep their registers data up to date. 

GDS provides operational support from 09:00 - 17:00 Monday-Friday.

Contact the GDS registers team at <a href="mailto:registerteam@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">registerteam@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a> if you have any problems or questions that are not covered in this guide. Please include error messages if relevant.
