## Support and community

GDS maintains the open registers APIs and helps custodians to run their open registers.

Contact the GDS open registers team at <a href="mailto:registerteam@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">registerteam@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a> if you have any problems or questions that are not covered in this guide. Please include error messages if relevant.
