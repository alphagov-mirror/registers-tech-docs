### Demo

**Food hygiene ratings**

The [food hygiene ratings service](http://openregister-food-ratings-demo.herokuapp.com/) demonstrates a service that uses multiple registers.

If you search for ‘byron’ you will be presented with a list of 3 Byron restaurants in London. By clicking on one of the restaurant ratings, you’ll see further information about that restaurant including its food premises number, business premises number, company number, inspection number and more.

This data is provided by numerous registers. By navigating to the bottom of the page, you’ll see a link to view 'register data’. If you click this link, you will see which data has been provided by each register.

By clicking the [CURIE Compact URL](https://www.w3.org/TR/curie/) for each register, for example `food-premises:516226` or `local-authority:506`, you will see the record for that data in the original register(s).
