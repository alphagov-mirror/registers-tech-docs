To start using open registers, you’ll need:  

* a new or existing digital service that needs a reliable source of data, such as a list of countries
* people with the development skills to build the technical integration with open registers

You will need to decide which data from open registers you need and how to present it to your users. You can choose to use all of the data in a register or just a part of it. Depending on your requirements, you may have to build indexes on top of open registers to fulfill specific requests such as search or matching.

For example, the country register does not contain misspelled names or alternative names of countries. However, you could build searching and matching engines on top of the register to find and match a user’s input to the relevant information in that register.
