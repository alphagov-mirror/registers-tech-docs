## CURIE

Inspired by the [CURIE Syntax 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/curie/), the CURIE
(compact URL) datatype provides a mechanism [to link
registers](/linked_registers).

CURIEs are of the form `{prefix}:{key}`, where `{prefix}` is mapped to a base
URL `https://{name-of-register}.register.gov.uk/records/`.
