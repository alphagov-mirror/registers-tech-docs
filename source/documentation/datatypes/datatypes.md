## CURIE

The CURIE (compact URL) datatype provides a mechanism [to link registers](/linked_registers).

This datatype is inspired by the [CURIE Syntax
1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/curie/) but is of the form `{prefix}:{key}`.

`{prefix}` is:

* always filled
* mapped to a base URL of the form
`https://{name-of-register}.register.gov.uk/records/`. 

The CURIE datatype complies with the URL specification rather than URL/URI/IRI
IETF specifications.

## Datetime

A datatype for date- and time-related data, that conforms to [ISO
8601](https://www.iso.org/standard/40874.html).
