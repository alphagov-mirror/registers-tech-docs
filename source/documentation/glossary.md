**custodian** - The person who is responsible for the data in the register. They're from the government department or agency responsible for the information in the register. They make sure the register is accurate and up-to-date.

**entry** - An entry describes how a record has changed over time. An entry is a particular set of fields and values that were correct at one point in time. Entries are ordered by when they were added to a register.

**field** - A data structure for a single piece of data and they are the smallest part of a register. Every item contains a set of fields. In the country register, fields include country, name, official-name, and citizen-name. Each field is a name that is used consistently between open registers. A list of all the fields that are used in open registers are kept in the field register.

**items** - An item is  made up of fields and values containing information. Items are the actual data contained within a register. For example, in the record for Great Britain in the country register, an item would be its country name, 'Great Britain' and its official citizen name, 'Brits'.

**record** - A record contains all the information about a single thing in a register. For example, in the country register, there are currently 199 records, one for each country recognised by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. A record points to the most recent entry.

**register** - A list of information designed to be an accurate and up-to-date source of data from government. Once entered into a register, the contents can only be added to, they cannot be deleted or rewritten.

**primary key** - A numeric or alphanumeric string. Records define themselves by a unique identifier associated with a single record in a register. A unique identifier can be a candidate for a primary key. The primary key always has the same name as the name of the register. For example, every entry in the country register has a field called country. This helps to link that entry specifically to the country register.
