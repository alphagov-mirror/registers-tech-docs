Registers are digital lists of accurate and up-to-date data about a particular topic from an authoritative source. For example, the [country register](https://country.register.gov.uk/) is a list of British English-language names and descriptive terms for countries. The [UK Government and Parliament petitions service](https://petition.parliament.uk/) uses the country register to populate a drop-down menu so a user can select their location.

Registers only provide raw data. You cannot use the APIs to search a register or match data. Depending on your requirements, you may have to build indexes on top of a register to fulfill specific requests.
