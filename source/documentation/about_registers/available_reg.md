The [register pipeline](https://registers.cloudapps.digital/registers) shows a list of registers in discovery, alpha, and beta.

Beta registers are safe to use in your service. For a register to move to live, it should be the only list of its kind. Until duplicate lists have been removed, a register will stay in beta.

Alpha registers are still in development and their shape and data may change. You are welcome to use alpha registers in your service, and we would appreciate any feedback you may have.

You can [contact the registers team](https://registers.cloudapps.digital/support.html) if you have any questions about any of the registers in the pipeline.
