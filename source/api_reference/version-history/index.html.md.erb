# Version history

## Current version
`v1` is the current version of the API.

You can access `v1` of the API using these base URLs:

- `https://{register}.register.gov.uk/v1/`
- `https://{register}.register.gov.uk/`

## API release cycle
`next` is a preview of the upcoming API before that API becomes stable. You should not use it in production, since the API may change without notice.

The release schedule is:

1. The GOV.UK Registers team releases the `next` API. You can use the `next` version of the API to test against backwards-incompatible changes before `next` becomes the stable API.
2. When the `next` API is stable, it will be renamed to the next version (eg `v2`).
3. After a set amount of time, the previous version of the API is deprecated.
